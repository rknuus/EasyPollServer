== About Easy Poll Server ==

Easy Poll Server is a web application to create polls and answer polls.
Besides filling in poll questions online the application also supports
answering a poll in XML format by smart phone clients.

An Android application is realized to process the XML format
and display the questions on a smart phone. The smart phone user can enter
her/his answers and post them.

Easy Poll Server collects all answers. The poll initiator can close a poll
and view the results.

The project is subject of an assignment. Further the authors get familiar
with Ruby on Rails and experiment with TDD.
