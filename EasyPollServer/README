== About Easy Poll Server

Easy Poll Server is a web application to create polls and attend polls.
Besides filling in poll questions online the application [will] also provide
questions of a poll in a simple text format to smart phone clients.

An Android application will be realized to process the simple text format
and display the questions on a smart phone. The smart phone user can enter
her/his answers and post them.

Easy Poll Server collects all answers. The poll initiator can close a poll
and download the results.

The project is subject of an assignment. Further the authors get familiar
with Ruby on Rails and experiment with TDD.
